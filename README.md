# TXT-to-Mbox
Converting txt files into a unique mbox file.

Story: I was trying to find an application to convert my .txt mail files into .mbox, which i had generated them using Thunderbird plugin "ImportExportTools", and i coundn't find one. So i created this programm using Java JDK8 and netbeans as an IDE that gets all .txt files and put their content into an .mbox file.

That's all folks, if anyone is interested feel free to contribute.
